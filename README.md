# Time Series Analysis and Prediction
 
 This is the final project for LighthouseLabs. It performs time series analysis and predicts future values based on statistical and ml models:


>   *   ARIMA
>   *   SARIMA
>   *   LSTM
>   *   CNN-LSTM
>   *   Conv-LSTM

The time series data is pulled from the EIA website for gasoline and other petroleum product consumption
